# Drum-Kit
Section 13: Advanced JavaScript and DOM Manipulation of the course 'The complete web development Bootcamp' with Angela

In this module more intermediate / advanced parts of the Document Object Model or the DOM,  here to show how can build a drum kit web site.

So by the end of this module you would have not only understood how to add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes so that you'll know when the user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on a particular button on your web site and you can respond to it, but you also end up with this awesome web site that you can impress all of your friends with.

So the way that this works is that we've got a number of keys here that represent different drums in a typical drum set. And when you click on any of these buttons then you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum. And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard.
